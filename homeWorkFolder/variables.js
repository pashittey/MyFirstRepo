// above are the examples of a String.
// Strings can represent words, paragraphs, or
// anything that needs to be text

var num 1, num 2, num 3
above show how to creat multiple variable at once
very useful when trying to keep lines used in Code 
at minimum.below shows how to use those variables.
num1 = 1000;
num2 = 100000
num3 = 100000000

var name, carCapacity, region;
name = 100;
carCarpacity = "six people";
region = name + carCapacity;
//variables dont have to be created for the name
//creat variables to hold data
var smallDedcimal = 10.46;
var anotherDecimal = 1.3;

var decimalThree = 33.02;
var twoD = anotherDecimal * decimalThree;
threeDee = twoD + anotherDecimal;
//above represents the data type decimal in
//use with variables
var notTrue = true;
var soTrue = false;
var theNextone = notTrue;
var anotherBoolean = true
//booleans are True - False values. They are very useful
//inside of conditions. in order for you to be able to
//enhance your code and make it a little more responsive
//you need to add conditionals. True / False conditions
//that start or stop your code.
